Using regular expressions we tallied how many of each bad word occurred in the original and Kidz Bop versions. To determine censorship trends over time we looked at all of the original songs that had instances of our bad words and calculated what proportion of bad word/original song pairs were removed in the corresponding Kidz Bop versions. Each bad word counts once per song even if it occurs multiple times in the song."},{"type":"text","value":"We manually screened a subset of songs for missing and/or unreliable lyrics on Genius, but there could be some lingering artefacts.
